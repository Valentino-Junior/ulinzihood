# Description
Ulinzihood is a web application that keeps users informed about what's going on in their neighborhood. The user logs in and establishes a profile, which decides what kind of information they get based on their location. Users may list their enterprises and view the entries of other businesses in the region. Users may also identify local security connections, such as police and health centers.

# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

1. Log in to the app and begin utilizing it.
2. Create a profile for myself, including a geographical location and the name of my area.
3. Make a list of all the various businesses in my area.
4. Obtain contact information for the local health agency and police department.
5. Make public posts that will be seen by everyone in my area.
